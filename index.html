    <p>Hi, my name is Teddy.  I'm Greek, and always looking for new experiences.  My mantra is YOLO.  Skydiving, mountain climbing, hiking, and more.  My YOLO list for 2019 is as follows: snowboarding, paragliding and more mountain climbing</p>
    <p>I used to fix computers since age 10.  I didn't have a good experience with technical support so...the manual was there and I started reading.  Fast forward a couple of years and I graduated with CS degree in Queens College.</p>
    <p>Finding a job wasn't easy...I mean yeah economy wasn't the best but Entry level position with 3 years experience required? Come on that's just dumb.  I finally found a volunteer technical support volunteer position at Columbia Psycjiatry.  After 6 months I was offered a job and from there I was working above my pay grade.  Building image servers, MBAM server and assistiing with administrative tasks.  I was up for anything.  I was very lucky that there were coworkers that appreciated my help and would help me in return.  Unfortunately opportunities to advance were not readily available and I had no choice but to look for another job.  I had to cut my recommendations to three from six.  Finally wihtin about 2 months I recieved three offers for an administrator position at GNS LLC.  We manage about 180+ clients</p>
